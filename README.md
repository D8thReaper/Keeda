Arduino project for making an insect type autonomous bot.

Inspired by an Indian insect. This is my first project on Arduino and the project is still under development. Will update as the project continues.

Any helps would be very grateful.

Cheers!


To run the project you need the basic arduino uno board, jumper cables, 2 DC motors, an ultrasonic sensor and batteries.

As a pre-requisite you need to download and import the NewPing library from http://code.google.com/p/arduino-new-ping/.

The site also has the basic breadboard configuration you will need to get started.
